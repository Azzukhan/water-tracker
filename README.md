# UK Water Tracker

This project consists of a Next.js frontend and a Django backend. The frontend fetches data from the backend using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.

## Getting Started

### 1. Backend

```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

To populate historical Scottish Water resource levels from the Wayback Machine,
run:

```
python manage.py import_scottish_history
```

To quickly view the current Scottish Water tables without interacting with the database, run:

```
python scripts/print_scottish_resources.py
```

### Scheduled Updates

Water level data is kept fresh using Celery beat. Every **Wednesday** the
backend automatically:

1. Scrapes the latest Scottish Water resource levels.
2. Retrieves new Severn Trent reservoir data and generates 4â€‘week
   forecasts.

No manual intervention is required as long as the Celery worker and beat
processes are running.

By default the backend runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2. Frontend

All Next.js code now resides in the `frontend` directory.
Create a `.env.local` file inside `frontend` (or copy from `frontend/.env.example`) and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the URL where the Django server is running:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Then install dependencies and start the Next.js app from within `frontend`:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
